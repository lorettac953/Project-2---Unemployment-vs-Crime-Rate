Project 2 Proposal 

Team 6:  Alexander San Filippo, Zack Snyder, Loretta Cortez

Topic:  An examination of the relationships between unemployment and wealth inequality on crime. Essentially, our working theory is that as opportunities in the legal labor market decrease an individualâ€™s incentive for participating in other revenue generating illegal activities will increase. To put it another way,  as traditional forms of income generation decrease the opportunity cost for participating in illegal activity will also decrease thus leading to higher levels of reported crime.
